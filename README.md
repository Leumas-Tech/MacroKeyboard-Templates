# MacroKeyboard-Templates

Here are some cool sketches I found and modified so we can easily make macro Keyboards!

Project Goal: I want to be able to make a keyboard I can walk around with, and use it to send commands to appliances or other devices that I have around the house. My next goal is to create a bluetooth or IR version of these keyboards for sending inputs, possiblyyy to turn on my computer, or soldering station! A button to immediately tun on music would be cool too! So besides the fun things I want, I beleieve theres alot of useful applications these could have for us, maybe we could even ditch the buttons and add voice control. We kinda already have it(SIRI & Alexa), but my objective is to allow people like us to make commands that fufill custom purposes that might not be the same for me as for you. If that makes sense? I hope? I tend not to. 
Ill leave it like this. 
For example We tell alexa turn on the lights, why cant she be smart enough to know what light I mean specifically? I wanna be less specific with our AI, while the AI simultaneously becomes ... more understanding?
